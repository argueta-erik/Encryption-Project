It is to my understanding:
I must create an encryption algorithm for Encr(x) and a Decr(y).
This equation must be invertible in order to determine Decr(x).

For example:
    Encr(x) = (17x + 7) mod 256
    Decr(y) = (y - 7)/17
The Encr(x) would apply to every character in the plaintext.

I need to understand where 256 applies with the decryption, and
review the different algorithms (ie Extended Euclidean Algorithm)
    - This reminds me of one of the materials I read; the first Medium article.
